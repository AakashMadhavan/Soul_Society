# Sentiment Analysis for Student Feedback

## Problem Statement

Universities often collect feedback from students regarding courses and professors. Analyzing this feedback manually is time-consuming and difficult to quantify.

## Task

The goal of this project is to develop a bot that automatically processes and categorizes student feedback using sentiment analysis. The bot will provide insights into overall sentiment (positive, neutral, or negative) and generate a summary report.

## Features

- **Automated Feedback Processing:** Streamline the collection and analysis of student feedback.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Classify feedback into positive, neutral, or negative categories.

## Technologies Used

- UiPath for automation
- Sentiment Analysis API (or Python integration for local analysis)
- Excel or database for feedback storage

## Getting Started

To run this project:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up the necessary environment for UiPath.
3. Integrate with a sentiment analysis API or prepare the Python script.
4. Collect student feedback data in a structured format (Excel or database).
5. Execute the bot to process and categorize the feedback.
